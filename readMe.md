README
This compiler was built from this tutorial: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/a-compiler-from-scratch

Compiler Version: 1.0

Ruby version 3.1.2

You will need to type code into the test.src file and the compiler will go over the lines one by one deciphering it.
There is JavaScript already in the test.rc file feel free to use which ever language you desire.

To run this program in the terminal do ruby "file_name.rb" | node

Version 1.0 works with functions, but not with "=" and variables.
